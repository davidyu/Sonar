Features
========

TODO for parser
DOIN discuss architecture for gcc
TODO design interface for loading game vocabulary/lang specs
TODO design output structure of parser
TODO compile: 
              user input            > Gibbs intermediate language
              grab glass of water
              take glass of water   > PLAYER TAKE GLASS
              ----
              unlock door
              use key on door
              unlock door with key
              open door
              open door with key    > KEY USE DOOR
DONE controller architecture:
{
    first-effort: ControllerSys manages all actions (entities)
    refine-if-necessary: Logic is distributed across different ControllerSys, with one MasterControllerSys
}
DONE inventory test
DOIN serialize json object into entity with respective components
{
    DONE create default object with a script for Look (prints "a jar of pickles")
    DONE implement automatic serialization of Vec2
    DONE implement automatic serialization of any object via constructor
    TODO implement automatic serialization of any object via field-filling
    TODO integrate NameRegistry so can get Entity from name
    ???? do we want to dynamically build components at runtime and be able to reference them?
    ???? do we need a robust debugger for dynamic object creation via scripts?
}
TODO write Makefiles and buildscripts for faster iteration
TODO design architecture for Teracts
TODO implment proof-of-concept (MVP) of Teracts
TODO design architecture for printing to stdout
TODO design story-flow and state architecture
{
    Main plot flow -> Tree/DAG/Linked List
    Sub plot flow -> Separate tree/DAG/Linked List
    How to query plot flow? Query main module or use components
    OR decentralized story flow (components never share data)
}
TODO design game save mechanics and architecture

Wishlists
=========

+ if have time, architect better portal/sector architecture

Bugfixes
========

TODO fix AdvancedParser ls command - maybe to do with bad getAllEntitiesOfContainer
